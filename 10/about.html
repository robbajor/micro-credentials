<h3>Key Method</h3>
	<p>
		The educator arranges furniture and space so students can easily transition from collaborative groups to direct instruction or individual work when using technology.
	</p>

<h3>Method Components</h3>
	<p>
		Based on a teacher&rsquo;s outcome for a lesson, they arrange the class layout by implementing learning clusters (also known as &ldquo;pods&rdquo;) and/or learning zones to support the blended learning model, in which students rotate through technology-assisted activities.
	</p>

	<p>
		Teachers who design an effective physical environment for technology-enabled learning improve the ability to personalize learning through the 1-to-1 device program.
	</p>

<h4>Clusters</h4>
	<p>
		Educator designs clusters in the learning environment that promote interactive and social activities. Clusters allow students to work in small groups of two to six, interact directly, see facial expressions, and establish eye contact.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Cluster Examples:</strong>
	</p>
	<ul type="square">
		<li>
			Teacher arranges three to four desks with chairs together to form collaborative space.
		</li>
		<li>
			Teacher uses large, rectangular, and/or high-top tables with chairs.
		</li>
		<li>
			Teacher can move easily from group to group to ask questions and facilitate discussions.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Learning Zones</h4>
	<p>
		Educator designs an area in a classroom for students to work in collaborative groups while others work independently. Learning zones allow students to move freely to the area that is appropriate for the type of work they are doing. Teacher can move from one area to another to inquire about new or retained information from students.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Learning Zone Examples:</strong>
	</p>
	<ul type="square">
		<li>
			Teacher uses a variety of furniture such as couches and beanbags to make it more conducive to create and collaborate.
		</li>
		<li>
			Teacher uses big tables, round or rectangular, to support collaborative group work.
		</li>
		<li>
			Teacher uses standing desks at various heights
		</li>
		<li>
			Teacher establishes a space to create a collaborative area for groups to meet and work.
		</li>
		<li>
			Whiteboard walls could be a collaboration space for students
		</li>
	</ul>
